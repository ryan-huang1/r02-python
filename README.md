# Colmi R02 Smart Ring Reverse Engineering Effort 

I've loved the idea of tracking my health, especially in a nice form factor like a sleek, stainless steel ring, but the monthly subscriptions and higher price tag have always been offputting to me.

I stumbled upon the Colmi 02 ring while browsing Twitter one day and found that some other folks were working to reverse engineer as well. This is just my personal effort to do it in a manner without making it into a library.

The goal here is to replicate all the functions from the QRing app, and integrate this into a web utility where users can access the rings function from a simple website

## Functionalities to Replicate 

- [x] Real-time heart rate
- [x] Sleep tracking
- [x] Checking the battery level and charging status
- [x] Real-time SPO2 data
- [x] Setting the time on the ring
- [x] Adjusting the heart rate logging frequency
- [ ] Accelerometer for step tracking
- [ ] Accelerometer for sleep tracking
- [ ] Accelerometer for gesture detection
- [ ] Get Blood oxygen (SPO2) history
- [ ] Get Heart rate history
- [ ] "Stress" measurement
- [ ] Retrieving device information (hardware/firmware versions)
